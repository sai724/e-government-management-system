<h1><marquee>AGRICULTURE DEPARTMENT </marquee></h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers' Welfare (formerly Ministry of Agriculture), a branch of the Government of India, is the apex body for formulation and administration of the rules and regulations and laws related to agriculture in India. 
The three broad areas of scope for the Ministry are agriculture, food processing and co-operation. The agriculture ministry is headed by Minister of Agriculture Narendra Singh Tomar.
Abhishek Singh Chauhan, Krishna Raj and Parsottambhai Rupala are the Ministers of State.

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Agriculture provides the bulk of wage goods required by non-agriculture sectors and most of the raw materials for the industries sector.
 India is a largely agrarian economy - with 52.1% of the population estimated to directly or indirectly employed in agriculture and allied sectors in 2009-10.
The combined efforts of Central Government, State Governments and the farming community have succeeded in achieving record production of 244.78 million tonnes of foodgrains during 2010-11.
 This record production has been achieved through effective transfer of newly developed crop production technologies to farmers under various crop development schemes, such as the Agriculture MMP, which is run under the direction of the Department of Agriculture & Cooperation.
 Other causes behind record production include remunerative prices for various crops through enhanced minimum support prices.
 Agriculture in India is of significance because of this as well as a history of food shortages and a growing population.
